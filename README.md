Research About Better Lights:
- Apparently you can use a property called "noiseTexture" in the godrays to simulate a non-uniform medium like fog.
- GodRays are limited to lights in the view area, we could try some things to make the system think the light is still in the view are or go with volumetric lights (a completely different approach)
- Research concluded for now...
